# Review_Classification_Model
Automating the process of tag and sentiment identification of OYO reviews using ML models (XGBoost and RoBERTa)


# Background:


Feedback management system helps businesses manage what customers are saying on multiple feedback platforms and channels, as well as gain data-driven insights essential to improving overall customer experience.


The 4 key elements in the guest feedback loop are:

Getting feedback from guest

Understanding the feedback

Taking an action on feedback

Closing the loop with guest

# Problem:


The task was accomplished through manual resources who used to understand the feedback, take an action and close the loop. This had multiple issues:

Cost of manual resources

High turnaround time

Human error while tagging the data

# Solution:

We are changing the current process of manually uploading the category wise tags and sentiment and automating the process using ML models(XGBoost and RoBERTa)

This automation will enable us to generate auto-replies for the user reviews

Eliminate human errors

This will also help us display category as well as sentiment wise reviews of all properties on OYO app and website.


We have built two ways to consume the sentiments and tags:

API solution, wherein you can provide multiple reviews alongwith their region and get category and probability as output.

Let us know the APIs that your service calls to get the feedback and we will parse the response to have sentiments and tags as well.

Consumer journey:


The Guest journey w.r.t Feedbacks would get changed from:

Guest giving Feedback and Reviews,


to:

Guests giving Feedback and Reviews,

Guests receiving custom acknowledgment for any issues highlighted (based on identifying issues from Reviews and Sentiment Analysis), or

Guests receiving the thank you note for sharing Good Feedback and Review, and

Guests get to know what actions have been taken to resolve the issues they faced during their previous stay (assigning the task to the PM on HMS/OS).


# Business Impact:


# Cost:

A lot of the business team's capacity goes in curating the feedback, identifying the L1 tags from the reviews, etc. This entire process can be automated.

At the same time, their capacity goes in manually replying to guest comments on OTAs. 


# Guest Experience and Repeat Business:

Involving guests in closing the entire Feedback loop will help in building trust with them and improves GX, and thereby getting repeat business.
